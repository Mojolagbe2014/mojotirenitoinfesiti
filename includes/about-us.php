                          <span>The <strong class="strong-logo">TRAIN<strong class="h2-red">2</strong>INVEST</strong> program is a comprehensive learning process designed to radically change the concept of wealth managment. No longer should you give your hard-earned money to a person who is less well-off than you - just because he wears a suit & talks like a politician1</span>
                          <br><br>
                          <span>CAPITAL PRESERVATION and WEALTH ACCUMULATION is the cornerstone of the <strong class="strong-logo">TRAIN<strong class="h2-red">2</strong>INVEST</strong> program.</span>
                          <br><br>
                          <span>The course has been designed that DOES NOT require PhD in finance... a complex subject is broken down to bite-sized pieces. Realizing that no two people study/understand concepts the same way, it is structured in such a way that an individual studies at their own pace!</span>
                          <br><br>

                          <span><strong> FIRST:</strong> calculate the COST that you are currently paying per year then multiply it 10 times.</span>
                          <br>
                          <strong>SECOND:</strong><span> What if you earned 5% p.a. on the COST that you just gave away? How much would that amount to?</span>
                          <br>
                          <strong>THIRD: </strong>
                          <span>What did you recieve for the fee that you paid? (Do you know the MER & management fee you paid?)</span>
